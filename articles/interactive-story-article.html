        <hr>
        <p>In this project I decided to focus on one of my favorite television programs.
            I appreciate the storytelling of Game of Thrones and how little choices can have
            a major impact on a characters Journey.<br>
            I decided to focus on a story driven narrative with a few battle sequences and highly impactful choices rather than
            riddles and token gameplay. I couldnt find a riddle that I thought would fit into the Game of Thrones
            universe.
