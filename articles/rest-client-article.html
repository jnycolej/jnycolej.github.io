    <h3>Implementation of a Blackjack Game:</h3>
    <h4>Code Overview</h4>
        <p>
            When coding for this project I went with a simplistic CSS/Bootstrap design because I wanted to focus on the actual gameplay.
            The code for this project is mainly written in JavaScript with HTML being used for the main page and in event handlers to relay
            crucial game infomation. When implementing the buttons I relied on innerHTML in order for the page to respond to clicks that the user
            commits during the gameplay instead of using a separate view.js file.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the gameplay code is located in round.js. This file is initiated whenever the user loads or reloads the website. Once initiated the program uses Fetch API to
            retrieve a shuffled deck of cards from the Deck of Cards API (<a href="https://deckofcardsapi.com">https://deckofcardsapi.com</a>) and deal to the dealer and the player. When programming the game initially
            I had both cards showing for the dealer and the player. However, this wasnt ideal as traditionally the dealer's second card is hidden until the player stands.
            In order to simulate this gameplay I dealt the dealer one card while dealing the player two cards. This allowed the game to resemble the traditional gameplay seen in real life.
